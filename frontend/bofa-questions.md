Got it. Situation **100% clear**.
I’ll be your **technical + interview mentor** for this BOFA frontend lead round.

You have **~12 hours**. Goal is **maximum ROI** → prepare what has **highest probability** of being asked, **plus** how they judge *communication, depth, and design thinking*.

Below is a **curated, senior-level Angular question list**.
If you prepare **ONLY these**, you’ll comfortably cover **~80–85% probability** of the interview.
