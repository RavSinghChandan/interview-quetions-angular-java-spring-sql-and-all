## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Basic Questions

1. **What are the core principles of OOP in Java?**

**🧩 Foundation:** The four core principles of OOP are:
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (fields) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features of an object.
- **Inheritance:** Mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and behaviors of another class.
- **Polymorphism:** Ability of an object to take many forms, typically via method overriding and interface implementation.

**🔁 Flow:**
```java
// Encapsulation
public class Account {
    private double balance; // private field
    public double getBalance() { return balance; }
    public void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
}

// Abstraction
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();
}

// Inheritance
class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() { System.out.println("Car started"); }
}

// Polymorphism
Vehicle v = new Car(); // v can refer to any subclass of Vehicle
v.start(); // Calls Car's start()
```
**🐞 Fixes:** Use encapsulation to protect data, abstraction to simplify interfaces, inheritance for code reuse, and polymorphism for flexibility.

2. **What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**

**🧩 Foundation:**
- **Abstraction:** Focuses on exposing only relevant information and hiding implementation details (e.g., interfaces, abstract classes).
- **Encapsulation:** Focuses on bundling data and methods and restricting access (e.g., private fields, public getters/setters).

**⚙️ Function:**
- Abstraction is about "what" an object does; encapsulation is about "how" it does it.

**🐞 Fixes:** Use abstraction for API design, encapsulation for data protection.

3. **What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?**

**🧩 Foundation:**
- **Interface:** Defines a contract; all methods are abstract (until Java 8+ default/static methods). Cannot have state (except static/final fields).
- **Abstract class:** Can have both abstract and concrete methods, and can maintain state (fields).

**⚙️ Function:**
- Use interfaces for type contracts; abstract classes for base implementations.

**🐞 Fixes:** Prefer interfaces for multiple inheritance, abstract classes for shared code.

### Intermediate Questions

1. **How does Java achieve polymorphism?**

**🧩 Foundation:** Java achieves polymorphism through method overriding (runtime) and method overloading (compile-time).

**⚙️ Function:**
- Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method declared in its superclass.
- Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

**🔁 Flow:**
```java
class Animal { void speak() { System.out.println("Animal"); } }
class Dog extends Animal { void speak() { System.out.println("Dog"); } }
Animal a = new Dog();
a.speak(); // Outputs "Dog" (runtime polymorphism)
```
**🐞 Fixes:** Use polymorphism for flexible and extensible code.

2. **What is the significance of the `final` keyword in Java?**

**🧩 Foundation:** The `final` keyword restricts modification:
- **final variable:** Value cannot be changed after initialization.
- **final method:** Cannot be overridden by subclasses.
- **final class:** Cannot be subclassed.

**🐞 Fixes:** Use `final` for constants, to prevent inheritance, and to ensure immutability.

3. **Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding.**

**🧩 Foundation:**
- **Overloading:** Same method name, different parameter lists, within the same class.
- **Overriding:** Subclass provides a specific implementation of a method declared in its superclass.

**🐞 Fixes:** Use overloading for convenience, overriding for polymorphism.

### Advanced Questions

1. **How does the `super` keyword work in Java, and when would you use it?**

**🧩 Foundation:** `super` refers to the immediate parent class object.
- Access parent class methods/fields
- Call parent class constructor

**🔁 Flow:**
```java
class Parent { void show() { System.out.println("Parent"); } }
class Child extends Parent {
    void show() { super.show(); System.out.println("Child"); }
}
```
**🐞 Fixes:** Use `super` to avoid ambiguity and to extend parent behavior.

2. **What is the difference between composition and inheritance? When would you use one over the other?**

**🧩 Foundation:**
- **Inheritance:** "is-a" relationship; subclass extends superclass.
- **Composition:** "has-a" relationship; class contains references to other classes.

**⚙️ Function:** Prefer composition for flexibility and to avoid tight coupling.

**🐞 Fixes:** Use inheritance for shared behavior, composition for code reuse and flexibility.

### Tough Questions

1. **How would you design a class hierarchy to ensure extensibility while preventing misuse through inheritance?**

**🧩 Foundation:**
- Use `final` for classes/methods you don't want extended/overridden.
- Use interfaces for extensibility.
- Use composition over inheritance.

**🐞 Fixes:** Document intended extension points, restrict inheritance where necessary.

### Situational / Real-world Questions

1. **You’re tasked with refactoring a legacy system with tightly coupled classes. How would you apply OOP principles to improve it?**

**🧩 Foundation:**
- Identify tightly coupled code and extract interfaces.
- Apply encapsulation, abstraction, and composition.

**🐞 Fixes:** Refactor to use interfaces, encapsulate state, and use composition for flexibility.

## 2. Java Classes and Objects

### Basic Questions

1. **What is the difference between a class and an object in Java?**

**🧩 Foundation:**
- **Class:** Blueprint or template for creating objects.
- **Object:** Instance of a class, with its own state and behavior.

**🐞 Fixes:** Use classes to define structure, objects to represent data.

2. **How do you create a singleton class in Java?**

**🧩 Foundation:** Singleton ensures only one instance of a class exists.

**🔁 Flow:**
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() { return INSTANCE; }
}
```
**🐞 Fixes:** Use private constructor, static instance, and thread-safe access.

### Intermediate Questions

1. **What are immutable objects, and how do you create one in Java?**

**🧩 Foundation:** Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation (e.g., `String`).

**🔁 Flow:**
```java
public final class Person {
    private final String name;
    public Person(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
}
```
**🐞 Fixes:** Use `final` fields, no setters, and return new objects for modifications.

2. **Explain the role of the `this` keyword in Java.**

**🧩 Foundation:** `this` refers to the current object instance.
- Disambiguates fields and parameters
- Passes current object as a parameter
- Calls other constructors in the same class

**🐞 Fixes:** Use `this` to avoid ambiguity and for fluent APIs.

### Advanced Questions

1. **How does the `clone()` method work, and what precautions should be taken when implementing it?**

**🧩 Foundation:** `clone()` creates a copy of an object. Implement `Cloneable` and override `clone()`.

**🐞 Fixes:** Implement deep copy for mutable fields, handle `CloneNotSupportedException`, and prefer copy constructors or static factory methods for clarity.

2. **What is the purpose of the `Object` class in Java?**

**🧩 Foundation:** `Object` is the root class of all Java classes. It provides methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, `clone()`, and `finalize()`.

**🐞 Fixes:** Override `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` for custom classes.

### Tough Questions

1. **How would you implement a deep copy of an object with nested references?**

**🧩 Foundation:** Deep copy duplicates all fields, including nested objects.

**🔁 Flow:**
```java
public class Node implements Cloneable {
    int value;
    Node next;
    public Node clone() {
        Node copy = new Node();
        copy.value = this.value;
        if (this.next != null) copy.next = this.next.clone();
        return copy;
    }
}
```
**🐞 Fixes:** Recursively clone nested objects, handle cycles carefully.

### Situational / Real-world Questions

1. **You need to ensure thread-safe instantiation of a singleton in a high-concurrency environment. How would you achieve this?**

**🧩 Foundation:** Use double-checked locking or enum singleton for thread safety.

**🔁 Flow:**
```java
public class ThreadSafeSingleton {
    private static volatile ThreadSafeSingleton instance;
    private ThreadSafeSingleton() {}
    public static ThreadSafeSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (ThreadSafeSingleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
**🐞 Fixes:** Use `volatile` and double-checked locking, or use enum for simple singletons.

## 3. Collections Framework

### Basic Questions

1. **What is the Java Collections Framework, and what are its main interfaces?**

**🧩 Foundation:** The Collections Framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections (groups of objects).

**⚙️ Function:** Provides interfaces (`Collection`, `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`) and implementations (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, etc.).

**🐞 Fixes:** Use the right interface for the use case (e.g., `List` for ordered, `Set` for unique, `Map` for key-value).

2. **What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?**

**🧩 Foundation:**
- **ArrayList:** Backed by a dynamic array; fast random access, slow inserts/removes in the middle.
- **LinkedList:** Doubly-linked list; fast inserts/removes, slow random access.

**🐞 Fixes:** Use `ArrayList` for frequent access, `LinkedList` for frequent inserts/removes.

### Intermediate Questions

1. **What is the difference between `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`, and `TreeMap`?**

**🧩 Foundation:**
- **HashMap:** Unordered, allows null keys/values, fast access.
- **LinkedHashMap:** Maintains insertion order.
- **TreeMap:** Sorted by keys, no null keys, slower than `HashMap`.

**🐞 Fixes:** Use `HashMap` for general use, `LinkedHashMap` for order, `TreeMap` for sorted keys.

2. **How does a `HashSet` ensure uniqueness of elements?**

**🧩 Foundation:** `HashSet` uses a `HashMap` internally; uniqueness is enforced by keys in the map.

**🐞 Fixes:** Override `equals()` and `hashCode()` for custom objects.

3. **What is the `ConcurrentHashMap`, and when would you use it?**

**🧩 Foundation:** `ConcurrentHashMap` is a thread-safe, high-performance map for concurrent access.

**🐞 Fixes:** Use for multi-threaded access, avoid `Hashtable` and synchronized maps for performance.

### Advanced Questions

1. **How does the internal implementation of `HashMap` handle collisions?**

**🧩 Foundation:** Collisions are handled by chaining (linked lists) or, since Java 8, by balanced trees for high-collision buckets.

**🐞 Fixes:** Use good hash functions, avoid excessive collisions.

2. **What are the benefits of using `Collections.synchronizedList` vs. `CopyOnWriteArrayList`?**

**🧩 Foundation:**

    public void run() { System.out.println("Runnable running"); }
}
new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start();
```
**🐞 Fixes:** Prefer `Runnable` for flexibility and separation of task from thread.

2. **What is the difference between `Thread` and `Runnable`?**

**🧩 Foundation:**
- `Thread` is a class; you subclass it to create a thread.
- `Runnable` is a functional interface; you implement it and pass to a `Thread`.

**🐞 Fixes:** Use `Runnable` for better OOP design and to allow multiple inheritance.

### Intermediate Questions

1. **What is the difference between synchronized block and synchronized method?**
