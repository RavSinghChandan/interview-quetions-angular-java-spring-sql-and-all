# 📘 Java Concurrency & Multithreading Evolution (Java 1 → Java 23)

This document covers the **Concurrency & Multithreading features** from **Java 1 (1996) to Java 23 (2025)**.

# 1. Threads & Synchronization

### Java 1 (1996)
- Basic **`Thread` class** and **`Runnable` interface** introduced.  
- Synchronization supported via `synchronized` keyword.  
- Primitives: `wait()`, `notify()`, `notifyAll()` for inter-thread communication.  

### Java 1.2–1.4 (1998–2002)
- Minor improvements, but concurrency was still low-level and error-prone.  

### Java 5 (2004)
- Major update: **java.util.concurrent** package.  
- Introduced `Lock`, `Semaphore`, `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`.  
- Reason: Better control than `synchronized`.  

### Java 6–7 (2006–2011)
- Performance improvements in `ThreadLocal`.  
- `Phaser` introduced in Java 7 for advanced synchronization.  

### Java 8 (2014)
- Lambdas + concurrency: easy thread tasks using functional syntax.  
- Example:  
  ```java
  new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Hello from thread")).start();
````

### Java 9 (2017)

* `Flow API` introduced → Reactive Streams for async data handling.

---

# 2. Executor Framework

### Java 5 (2004)

* **Executor Framework introduced**:

    * `Executor`, `ExecutorService`, `ScheduledExecutorService`.
    * `Future` for async results.

### Java 7 (2011)

* `ForkJoinPool` integrated into Executors.

### Java 8 (2014)

* **CompletableFuture** added for async pipelines.

    * Example:

      ```java
      CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "data")
                       .thenApply(String::toUpperCase)
                       .thenAccept(System.out::println);
      ```

### Java 9 (2017)

* `Flow` (Reactive Streams) integrated with Executor model.

---

# 3. Fork/Join Framework

### Java 7 (2011)

* **Fork/Join Framework introduced** for parallelism.
* Breaks tasks into smaller subtasks (divide & conquer).
* Example: `RecursiveTask`, `RecursiveAction`.

### Java 8 (2014)

* **Parallel Streams** internally used Fork/Join.
* Example: `list.parallelStream().forEach(System.out::println);`

### Java 21 (2023)

* Fork/Join seamlessly works with **virtual threads**.

---

# 4. Virtual Threads (Project Loom)

### Java 19 (2022, preview)

* **Virtual Threads** introduced.
* Lightweight, non-OS threads → scale to millions of concurrent tasks.

### Java 20 (2023, preview)

* Refinements to Virtual Threads API.

### Java 21 (2023 LTS)

* **Virtual Threads finalized**.

* Example:

  ```java
  try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
      IntStream.range(0, 1_000_000)
               .forEach(i -> executor.submit(() -> System.out.println(i)));
  }
  ```

* Reason: Solve scalability limits of traditional threads.

---

# 5. Structured Concurrency

### Java 19 (2022, incubator)

* **Structured Concurrency API** previewed.
* Idea: Manage multiple related tasks as a single unit.

### Java 21 (2023, preview)

* Structured Concurrency improved.
* Example:

  ```java
  try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
      Future<String> f1 = scope.fork(() -> task1());
      Future<String> f2 = scope.fork(() -> task2());
      scope.join(); // Wait for both
      scope.throwIfFailed();
  }
  ```

### Java 23 (2025)

* Expected to become standard API.

# ✅ Summary

Concurrency in Java evolved from **manual threads (Java 1)** → to **high-level concurrency APIs (Java 5)** → to **reactive & async (Java 8–9)** → and finally to **Virtual Threads + Structured Concurrency (Java 21+)**.

Key milestones:

* **Java 1:** Basic threads.
* **Java 5:** Concurrency utilities + Executor framework.
* **Java 7:** Fork/Join for parallelism.
* **Java 8:** CompletableFuture & parallel streams.
* **Java 9:** Reactive Streams.
* **Java 21:** Virtual Threads + Structured Concurrency.

Java now supports **millions of lightweight concurrent tasks**, making it competitive with Go, Kotlin, and other async-first languages.

Do you want me to now continue with **Section 5 (JVM & Memory)** in the same style and append it into this master handbook?
