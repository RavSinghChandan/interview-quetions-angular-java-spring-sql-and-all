---

## **Set A – Angular (UI Focus)**

---

### **1. What are the key features of Angular?**

**Answer:**
Angular is a TypeScript-based front-end framework developed by Google. Key features:

* **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable UI components.
* **Two-Way Data Binding**: Syncs data between model and view.
* **Dependency Injection**: Promotes modularity and testing.
* **RxJS & Observables**: Reactive programming for handling asynchronous data.
* **Directives & Pipes**: Extend HTML and transform data in templates.
* **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**: Improves performance.
* **Modular Development**: Organized feature modules with lazy loading.

👉 Example:

```ts
@Component({
 selector: 'app-hero',
 templateUrl: './hero.component.html'
})
export class HeroComponent {
 @Input() hero: Hero;
}
```

---

### **2. Difference between Template-driven and Reactive Forms**

**Answer:**

| Feature      | Template-Driven Forms | Reactive Forms             |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Approach     | Declarative           | Programmatic               |
| Form Control | Defined in template   | Defined in component class |
| Scalability  | Less scalable         | More scalable              |
| Validation   | HTML + directives     | Angular’s `Validators`     |
| Best For     | Simple forms          | Complex and dynamic forms  |

👉 Quick Reactive Form Example:

```ts
this.loginForm = this.fb.group({
  email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]],
  password: ['', Validators.required]
});
```

---

### **3. What is Change Detection? How does Angular handle it?**

**Answer:**

* Angular uses a **Change Detection mechanism** to update the DOM when data changes.
* It runs in response to:

    * User events
    * XHR responses
    * `setTimeout` / `setInterval`

Angular uses **Zone.js** to detect async operations and then **triggers change detection**.
Two change detection strategies:

* **Default** – Full tree scan.
* **OnPush** – Triggers only when `@Input` changes (performance booster).

👉 Use OnPush:

```ts
@Component({
 changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
```

---

### **4. Lifecycle Hooks – Can you explain them with a real use case?**

**Answer:**

| Hook              | Use                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `ngOnInit`        | Fetch data when component loads |
| `ngOnChanges`     | Respond to `@Input()` changes   |
| `ngAfterViewInit` | DOM access                      |
| `ngOnDestroy`     | Cleanup (e.g., unsubscribing)   |

**Use case:**

```ts
ngOnInit() {
 this.service.getUsers().subscribe(data => this.users = data);
}

ngOnDestroy() {
 this.subscription.unsubscribe();
}
```

---

### **5. What is Lazy Loading and why is it important?**

**Answer:**
Lazy Loading is the practice of loading feature modules **only when they are needed** (on navigation).

**Benefits:**

* Faster initial load time
* Optimized performance
* Better scalability

👉 Example in routing:

```ts
{
 path: 'admin',
 loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.module').then(m => m.AdminModule)
}
```

---

### **6. How do you optimize Angular app performance?**

**Answer:**

* Use `OnPush` change detection
* Lazy load feature modules
* Use `trackBy` in `*ngFor`
* Avoid memory leaks (unsubscribe)
* Enable AOT compilation
* Minimize watchers
* Use async pipes with observables
* Minify, compress, and bundle assets

---

### **7. Difference between `ngIf` and `*ngIf`, `ngFor` and `trackBy`**

**Answer:**

* `*ngIf` is structural – it adds/removes elements from DOM.
* `ngIf` (without `*`) used with `<ng-template>`.

**trackBy** improves rendering performance in `*ngFor`:

```ts
*ngFor="let user of users; trackBy: trackByUserId"
trackByUserId(index, user) {
 return user.id;
}
```

---

### **8. How do you handle API integration in Angular?**

**Answer:**
Use `HttpClient` (from `@angular/common/http`):

```ts
constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

getUsers(): Observable<User[]> {
 return this.http.get<User[]>('/api/users');
}
```

Use `async` pipe in template to subscribe:

```html
<div *ngFor="let user of users$ | async">{{ user.name }}</div>
```

---

### **9. What are Observables and how are they different from Promises?**

**Answer:**

| Feature         | Promise | Observable              |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| Eager           | Yes     | No                      |
| Multiple values | No      | Yes                     |
| Operators       | No      | Yes (map, filter, etc.) |
| Cancelable      | No      | Yes                     |
| Lazy            | No      | Yes                     |

Use `subscribe()` or `async` pipe to consume Observables.

---

### **10. What is a Service in Angular? How do you share data?**

**Answer:**

* A **service** is a singleton class for business logic and data sharing.
* Shared via `providedIn: 'root'` (tree-shakable singleton).
* Use RxJS `BehaviorSubject` or `Subject` to share data across components.

```ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class UserService {
 private user = new BehaviorSubject<User>(null);
 user$ = this.user.asObservable();

 updateUser(u: User) {
   this.user.next(u);
 }
}
```

---

### ✅ Tips to Deliver Like a Pro:

* Structure your answers: **Definition → Real-world use case → Code**
* Always mention **Angular version** you're using (e.g., "Since Angular 13...")
* Show initiative: Talk about **performance**, **accessibility**, **cross-browser testing**, and **team collaboration**
* Refer to **real modules** or screens you’ve built

---

Would you like me to proceed with **Set B – Java + Spring Boot** next?


Absolutely! Let's now go through **Questions 10 to 15 from Set A (Angular)** in a way that you'll **understand deeply, retain easily, and deliver like a pro** during your interview.

---

## ✅ **A10. How do you handle route guards in Angular?**

### 🔹 Purpose:

Route guards prevent unauthorized access to certain routes.

### 🔹 Types:

* `CanActivate` – prevent access before route loads.
* `CanActivateChild` – same but for child routes.
* `CanDeactivate` – prompt before leaving a route (e.g., unsaved changes).
* `Resolve` – pre-fetch data before loading route.
* `CanLoad` – prevent lazy-loaded modules from loading.

### 🔹 Example: `AuthGuard`

```ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private auth: AuthService, private router: Router) {}
  canActivate(): boolean {
    if (this.auth.isLoggedIn()) return true;
    this.router.navigate(['/login']);
    return false;
  }
}
```

### 🔹 Usage in Routing Module:

```ts
{ path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard] }
```

✅ *In interview*: Mention a real-life case like securing `/admin` or `/profile`.

---

## ✅ **A11. What are Observables and how are they different from Promises?**

### 🔹 Observable (from RxJS):

* Stream of data over time.
* **Lazy**, **cancelable**, **supports multiple values**, supports **operators (map, filter, etc.)**

### 🔹 Promise:

* Handles a single async value.
* Eager and cannot be canceled.

### 🔹 Example:

```ts
this.http.get('/api/data')   // returns Observable
  .subscribe(data => console.log(data));  // you subscribe to receive data
```

| Feature         | Observable          | Promise      |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Lazy            | ✅                   | ❌ (eager)    |
| Multiple values | ✅ (streams)         | ❌ (one-time) |
| Cancelable      | ✅ (`unsubscribe`)   | ❌            |
| Operators       | ✅ (`map`, `filter`) | ❌            |

✅ *In interview*: Emphasize real-time use cases like search autosuggest or live updates.

---

## ✅ **A12. How do you implement forms in Angular?**

Angular offers 2 main approaches:

### 1. **Template-driven forms**

* Simpler, uses Angular directives
* Ideal for basic forms

```html
<form #f="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="submitForm(f)">
  <input name="email" ngModel required />
</form>
```

### 2. **Reactive forms (recommended for complex apps)**

* Fully in TypeScript, more scalable and testable

```ts
form = this.fb.group({
  email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]]
});
```

```html
<form [formGroup]="form" (ngSubmit)="submitForm()">
  <input formControlName="email" />
</form>
```

✅ *Use `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, and validators for dynamic and nested forms.*

---

## ✅ **A13. How does Angular handle HTTP calls?**

* Angular uses the **HttpClient** service from `@angular/common/http`.

### 🔹 Example:

```ts
constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

getUsers() {
  return this.http.get<User[]>('/api/users');
}
```

### 🔹 Features:

* Returns **Observable**
* Use **interceptors** for logging/authentication
* Supports advanced configs: headers, params, retry

✅ *In interview*: Mention `interceptors` for adding auth tokens and `error handling` with `catchError`.

---

## ✅ **A14. What are Angular lifecycle hooks?**

These are special methods that Angular calls during component creation and destruction.

| Hook                | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `ngOnInit()`        | Called once after first render (init logic) |
| `ngOnChanges()`     | On input changes                            |
| `ngDoCheck()`       | Custom change detection                     |
| `ngAfterViewInit()` | After component’s view is initialized       |
| `ngOnDestroy()`     | Cleanup before component destroyed          |

### 🔹 Example:

```ts
ngOnInit() {
  this.loadUserData();
}

ngOnDestroy() {
  this.subscription.unsubscribe();
}
```

✅ *Remember*: Always clean up subscriptions in `ngOnDestroy()` to prevent memory leaks.

---

## ✅ **A15. How do you manage global state in Angular?**

For large-scale apps, you need to manage shared state across components and modules.

### Options:

1. **Service with Subjects/BehaviorSubject**

   ```ts
   private user$ = new BehaviorSubject<User>(null);
   getUser(): Observable<User> { return this.user$.asObservable(); }
   ```

2. **NgRx (Redux for Angular)** – for complex state

    * Uses Actions, Reducers, Selectors, Effects
    * Ideal for apps with shared, reactive, async state

3. **Signals** (from Angular 16+) – fine-grained reactivity

✅ *In interview*: If you’re not using NgRx now, say you use `BehaviorSubject` or `ReplaySubject` in services.

---

Let me know if you want a **quick summary sheet** to revise this set later, or shall we continue to **A16–A20** or move to another section like **B or C**?
Perfect! Let's now go through **Set B (Java + Spring Boot)** – Questions 1 to 10 – with **high-impact answers**, structured so that you can **understand, remember, and confidently deliver** in your Magnit 3rd-round interview.

---

## ✅ **B1. What is Spring Boot and why is it used?**

### 🔹 Definition:

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that simplifies Spring application development by auto-configuring everything and reducing boilerplate setup.

### 🔹 Why use it?

* Embedded server (Tomcat, Jetty)
* Zero XML config – everything is Java-based
* Production-ready with `actuator`
* Faster development (devtools, CLI)
* Starter dependencies simplify pom.xml

✅ *In interview*: "Spring Boot helps me rapidly build and deploy RESTful microservices with minimal configuration."

---

## ✅ **B2. How do you create a REST API in Spring Boot?**

### 🔹 Step-by-step:

1. Annotate your class:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/users")
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping
    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
        return userService.getAll();
    }
}
```

2. Return `ResponseEntity<T>` for control over status & headers.

3. Annotate `@Service`, `@Repository` in respective layers.

✅ *Mention*: Follow layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository).

---

## ✅ **B3. What is the difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`?**

| Annotation        | Purpose                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `@Component`      | Generic Spring-managed bean                 |
| `@Service`        | Business logic layer                        |
| `@Repository`     | Data access layer (also handles exceptions) |
| `@Controller`     | MVC controller                              |
| `@RestController` | `@Controller + @ResponseBody`               |

✅ *In interview*: “I use `@Service` for business logic, `@Repository` for DAO layer, and `@RestController` for API endpoints.”

---

## ✅ **B4. What is dependency injection and how is it implemented in Spring?**

### 🔹 Concept:

DI is a design pattern where objects are passed dependencies rather than creating them.

### 🔹 Types:

* Constructor injection (recommended)
* Field injection (not testable)
* Setter injection

### 🔹 Example:

```java
@Service
public class UserService {
  private final UserRepository repo;

  public UserService(UserRepository repo) {
    this.repo = repo;
  }
}
```

✅ *Spring injects dependencies at runtime from the application context.*

---

## ✅ **B5. What is the Spring Boot application lifecycle?**

### 🔹 Phases:

1. **Initialization**: `SpringApplication.run()`
2. **Component Scan** + Bean creation
3. **Dependency Injection**
4. **CommandLineRunner / ApplicationRunner** executes
5. **Embedded server starts**
6. **App is ready to serve requests**

✅ *Bonus*: Use `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` for lifecycle hooks.

---

## ✅ **B6. How do you handle exceptions in Spring Boot?**

### 🔹 Basic Way:

```java
@RestControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    @ExceptionHandler(UserNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleNotFound(UserNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
```

### 🔹 Bonus:

Use `@ControllerAdvice` for MVC, `@RestControllerAdvice` for REST.

✅ *In interview*: Mention global exception handling and logging strategies.

---

## ✅ **B7. What is Spring Data JPA and how does it simplify database access?**

### 🔹 Benefits:

* Eliminates boilerplate code
* Built-in CRUD operations
* Uses interfaces, no need for implementations

### 🔹 Example:

```java
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    Optional<User> findByEmail(String email);
}
```

✅ *In interview*: Say you use it with MySQL/PostgreSQL and write custom queries when needed using `@Query`.

---

## ✅ **B8. What is the difference between `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, and `@GeneratedValue`?**

| Annotation         | Purpose                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `@Entity`          | Marks a class as a JPA entity (table)                |
| `@Table(name=...)` | Optional – custom table name                         |
| `@Id`              | Marks primary key                                    |
| `@GeneratedValue`  | Specifies how PK is generated (AUTO, IDENTITY, etc.) |

### 🔹 Example:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
  private Long id;
}
```

---

## ✅ **B9. What is the role of application.properties / application.yml?**

### 🔹 Purpose:

Used to configure app-wide settings.

### 🔹 Common configs:

```properties
server.port=8081
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
```

✅ *Mention*: You use profiles (`application-dev.yml`, `application-prod.yml`) for environment-based configs.

---

## ✅ **B10. What are Profiles in Spring Boot?**

### 🔹 Concept:

Spring Profiles allow you to define different configurations for different environments (dev, test, prod).

### 🔹 Usage:

```properties
# application-dev.properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/dev_db
```

```java
@Profile("dev")
@Component
public class DevDataSeeder implements CommandLineRunner {
  public void run(String... args) { /* seed dev data */ }
}
```

✅ *Activate Profile*:

```bash
-Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```

---

Let me know when you're ready for **B11 to B20**, or if you'd like a **flashcard summary / printable sheet** for fast review.
Absolutely! Let’s complete **Set B (Java + Spring Boot)** with:

## ✅ **B11. What is the difference between `@RequestParam`, `@PathVariable`, and `@RequestBody`?**

| Annotation      | Purpose                              | Example URL or Usage                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `@RequestParam` | Extracts **query param** from URL    | `/users?name=Chandan`                |
| `@PathVariable` | Extracts **value from URL path**     | `/users/123` → `@PathVariable("id")` |
| `@RequestBody`  | Binds **JSON body** to a Java object | `{ "name": "Chandan" }`              |

### 🔹 Example:

```java
@GetMapping("/users")
public String getUser(@RequestParam String name) { return name; }

@GetMapping("/users/{id}")
public String getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) { return id.toString(); }

@PostMapping("/users")
public String createUser(@RequestBody User user) { return user.getName(); }
```

✅ *In interview*: “I use `@RequestBody` for POST/PUT, `@RequestParam` for filters, and `@PathVariable` for resource identifiers.”

---

## ✅ **B12. What are Spring Boot Starters?**

### 🔹 Concept:

**Starters** are pre-packaged dependency bundles to reduce setup time.

### 🔹 Common Starters:

| Starter Name                   | Purpose                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `spring-boot-starter-web`      | Build RESTful apps with Spring MVC |
| `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` | JPA + Hibernate integration        |
| `spring-boot-starter-test`     | JUnit, Mockito, etc. for testing   |
| `spring-boot-starter-security` | Spring Security setup              |

✅ *In interview*: “I use Spring Boot starters to quickly include necessary dependencies, reducing boilerplate and avoiding version conflicts.”

---

Let me know if you'd like **B13–B20** or want **a cheat sheet / printable one-pager** to revise this quickly before the interview.
Here is **Set C: System Design + Architecture** — with detailed, structured answers to help you deliver confidently like a pro in your 3rd-round interview at Magnit Global.

---

### ✅ **Set C – System Design & Architecture Questions + Answers**

---

### **1. How would you design a scalable web application?**

**Answer:**
To design a scalable web app:

* **Client Layer:** Responsive Angular UI (mobile-first, lazy loading, code splitting).
* **API Gateway / Backend-for-Frontend (BFF):** For auth, routing, caching.
* **Backend Layer (Spring Boot):**

    * Layered Architecture (Controller, Service, DAO).
    * Use DTOs and separation of concern.
* **Database:**

    * Relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL) for consistency.
    * NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) for flexibility or caching.
* **Scalability:**

    * **Horizontal scaling** via load balancers (NGINX, AWS ELB).
    * **Stateless services** for easier scaling.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Kafka/RabbitMQ for background jobs (emails, analytics).
* **Caching:** Redis or Memcached for hot data (e.g., user profile).
* **Security:** JWT/OAuth2, HTTPS, rate-limiting.

🧠 Tip: Mention monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) and CI/CD.

---

### **2. Monolith vs Microservices – What’s the difference? When do you use what?**

**Monolith:**

* All features in one deployable artifact.
* Easier to start and test.
* Harder to scale, update one part without affecting others.

**Microservices:**

* Each service is independent (own DB, deploy separately).
* Built around business domains.
* Need DevOps maturity.

**When to use:**

* Start with a modular monolith → move to microservices when:

    * You need independent scalability.
    * Teams are large and distributed.
    * CI/CD is mature.
    * Services evolve at different paces.

---

### **3. What is Domain-Driven Design (DDD)?**

**Answer:**
DDD is about structuring code around **business domains**. It emphasizes:

* **Entities** – Objects with unique identity (e.g., `Order`, `Customer`).
* **Value Objects** – Objects defined by value (e.g., `Address`, `Money`).
* **Aggregates** – Cluster of domain objects with a root.
* **Repositories** – Abstractions over data access.
* **Bounded Contexts** – Clear boundaries for models to avoid conflicts.

Use DDD when:

* Business is complex.
* You want clean separation of domains.
* You're heading toward microservices.

---

### **4. How do you design a RESTful API?**

**Best Practices:**

* **HTTP Methods:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH.
* **Resource Naming:** Use nouns – `/users/{id}/orders`
* **Status Codes:** 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found, 500 Error.
* **Versioning:** `/api/v1/...`
* **Filtering/Sorting:** `/products?sort=price&limit=10`
* **Authentication:** OAuth2/JWT.
* **Rate Limiting & Pagination**: For large data.

Example:

```json
GET /api/v1/customers/123/orders

{
  "orderId": 678,
  "amount": 420,
  "items": [...]
}
```

---

### **5. How would you secure a modern web application?**

**Frontend (Angular):**

* Use Angular's built-in XSS protection.
* Use route guards for protected pages.
* Store tokens securely (preferably in memory or HttpOnly cookies).

**Backend (Spring Boot):**

* **JWT/OAuth2** for authentication.
* **RBAC/ABAC** for authorization.
* Enable HTTPS.
* Protect endpoints (Spring Security).
* Input validation (avoid injection attacks).
* Rate limiting (bucket4j, Redis).

**General:**

* CSRF protection.
* Use security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options).
* Audit logging.

---

### **6. How would you handle concurrency in a Java application?**

**Options:**

* **Synchronized blocks** or **ReentrantLock** – for low-level control.
* **Executors / ThreadPoolExecutor** – for managing thread pools.
* **Atomic variables / ConcurrentHashMap** – lock-free concurrency.
* **Optimistic Locking (JPA):** with `@Version` field.
* **Messaging Queue:** For distributed concurrency.

Use cases:

* Banking: optimistic/pessimistic locking for money transfers.
* APIs: use Redis + Lua script to handle race conditions.

---

### **7. How would you cache data?**

**Levels of Caching:**

1. **Client-side:** Angular browser cache, Service Workers.
2. **Server-side (Spring Boot):**

    * Use `@Cacheable`, `@CacheEvict`, etc.
    * Cache Manager with Redis/Ehcache.
3. **Database-side:**

    * Query caching (Hibernate 2nd level cache).
    * Read replicas.

**When to invalidate:**

* On updates (`@CacheEvict`).
* TTL expiry (Redis).
* Application logic (e.g., versioning strategy).

---

### **8. How do you scale a Spring Boot application?**

**Horizontally:**

* Use multiple instances behind load balancer (AWS ELB, NGINX).
* Externalize config (Spring Cloud Config).
* Session management with Redis if needed.

**Vertically:**

* Optimize JVM heap, GC, thread pool sizes.

**Add-on:**

* Use Docker + Kubernetes.
* Auto-scaling policies (HPA).

---

### **9. How do you log and monitor an application in production?**

**Logging:**

* Use SLF4J + Logback.
* Use structured JSON logs (e.g., Logstash encoder).
* Use log aggregators: ELK (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana) or Loki.

**Monitoring:**

* Use Prometheus + Grafana.
* Health endpoints (`/actuator/health`).
* APM tools: NewRelic, Datadog.

**Alerting:**

* Set up alerts on CPU/memory/db latency/errors.
* Integrate with Slack or email.

---

### **10. How do you do graceful shutdown in Spring Boot?**

**Answer:**

* Use `@PreDestroy` in beans for cleanup.
* Implement `SmartLifecycle` or `DisposableBean`.
* Close DB connections, stop background threads.
* Enable `server.shutdown=graceful` in `application.yml`.
* Delay shutdown until active tasks complete.

---

If you're ready, I can now prepare you for:

* **Mock delivery tips** (how to say this fluently in interview).
* **Set D (Behavioral)**
* Or dive into deeper design discussions (e.g., design Google Calendar or Netflix backend).

Let me know where to go next.
You're right to ask — let's make **Set C (System Design & Architecture)** **100% complete**, covering any remaining questions or frequently asked system design topics that might come up in your **Senior Software Engineer - UI (Java + Angular)** interview at **Magnit Global**.

Below are **additional high-impact C-level questions**, not yet covered, but commonly asked in senior-level interviews:

---

### ✅ **\[11] How would you design a rate-limiter?**

**Techniques:**

1. **Token Bucket Algorithm**
2. **Leaky Bucket**
3. **Fixed Window**
4. **Sliding Window Log / Counter**

**Simple solution (Spring Boot + Redis):**

* Use `bucket4j` or Redis + Lua script.
* Key = userId + endpoint.
* TTL reset every interval (1 min / 10 sec).

**Example (Redis):**

```lua
if current_request_count < threshold then
  increment count
else
  block request
end
```

Use for:

* API gateways
* Abuse/spam protection
* Login throttling

---

### ✅ **\[12] How do you implement pagination and filtering?**

**Backend:**

* Spring Data JPA:

```java
Pageable pageable = PageRequest.of(0, 10, Sort.by("createdAt").descending());
Page<User> users = userRepository.findByStatus("ACTIVE", pageable);
```

**Frontend (Angular):**

* Use query params:

```
GET /users?page=1&size=10&sort=createdAt,DESC&filter=name:john
```

Benefits:

* Reduces payload
* Improves UI responsiveness
* Essential for large datasets (e.g., logs, users, transactions)

---

### ✅ **\[13] Explain eventual consistency and where you’ve used it.**

**Definition:**

* In distributed systems, not all nodes are immediately consistent, but they **eventually converge** to the same state.

**Use cases:**

* Email/sms notifications
* Distributed DBs (Cassandra, DynamoDB)
* Asynchronous communication (Kafka)

**Your answer could be:**

> "In a previous project, we had order confirmation emails triggered asynchronously via Kafka consumers. We acknowledged the order to the user immediately, and the email would follow in an eventually consistent manner."

---

### ✅ **\[14] How would you design file upload and download features securely?**

**Upload:**

* Use S3 or Blob Storage
* Scan for virus/malware
* Generate pre-signed URLs
* Validate file size, extension

**Download:**

* Secure signed URLs (short expiry)
* Set `Content-Disposition` headers for browser download
* Use CDN for large files

**Spring Boot Example:**

```java
@GetMapping("/files/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Resource> download(@PathVariable Long id) { ... }
```

---

### ✅ **\[15] How do you handle failures in microservices?**

**1. Retry Mechanism:**

* With exponential backoff
* Use `resilience4j` or `spring-retry`

**2. Circuit Breaker:**

* If service fails consistently, open the circuit
* Retry later
* Tools: `Resilience4j`, `Hystrix`

**3. Fallback Methods:**

* Return cached/default response

**4. Timeout Controls:**

* Prevent blocking upstream

**5. Monitoring & Alerts:**

* Detect failure early

**Sample:**

```java
@Retryable(value = RemoteServiceException.class, maxAttempts = 3)
public String callRemoteService() { ... }
```

---

### ✅ **\[16] How do you decide between SQL and NoSQL in a system design?**

**SQL (Relational):**

* ACID transactions
* Structured schema
* Joins and relations
* Use: Banking, ERP, Order Mgmt

**NoSQL (Document/Key-Value):**

* Flexible schema
* High read/write throughput
* Horizontal scaling
* Use: Caching, Product catalog, Event logs

**Real-world:**

> "We used PostgreSQL for transaction data and MongoDB for user activity logs to optimize both consistency and flexibility."

---

### ✅ **\[17] How do you handle versioning of REST APIs?**

**Best Practices:**

* URI versioning: `/api/v1/orders`
* Media type versioning: `Accept: application/vnd.company.v1+json`
* Header versioning (less common)

**Maintain backward compatibility:**

* Avoid breaking changes
* Deprecate older versions slowly

**Why?**

> Teams using your API may not upgrade immediately, so semantic versioning helps prevent outages.

---

### ✅ **\[18] What is CAP Theorem and how does it relate to system design?**

**CAP = Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance**

* **Consistency:** All nodes return latest data
* **Availability:** System always responds (even if stale)
* **Partition Tolerance:** Works even if network split occurs

**Pick 2 in a network failure:**

* CP: MongoDB, HBase
* AP: Couchbase, DynamoDB

In distributed systems, partition tolerance is a must, so we trade-off between C and A.

---

### ✅ **\[19] How do you migrate a monolithic system to microservices?**

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Identify bounded contexts**
2. **Extract one module** (e.g., Auth, Order)
3. Create a **new service with its own DB**
4. Communicate via REST/Kafka
5. Use **API Gateway** for routing
6. Gradually deprecate monolith endpoints

**Tip:** Use strangler pattern: new microservices replace parts of old monolith gradually.

---

### ✅ **\[20] What is CQRS and when should you use it?**

**CQRS = Command Query Responsibility Segregation**

* **Commands = Writes**
* **Queries = Reads**
* Different models for read/write → better performance and scalability

**Use When:**

* Complex domains with heavy reads and writes
* Event sourcing
* Analytics dashboard

**Don’t Use When:**

* Simple CRUD app

---

### ✅ Final Check – Set C is Now Fully Covered With:

✅ Core system design
✅ Spring Boot architectural decisions
✅ Caching, scaling, logging, API security
✅ Real-world use cases
✅ Communication patterns (Kafka, REST)
✅ Consistency, failover, monitoring

---

### **D4. How do you handle conflict in a team?**

**Answer:**
I focus on the issue, not the person. I had a conflict with a backend teammate about API contract expectations. Instead of escalating, I scheduled a sync-up, clarified our understandings with data, and involved the BA to finalize the schema.
The result was better collaboration, and we even built a contract-first design guideline that the whole team adopted later.

---

### **D5. What’s your leadership style?**

**Answer:**
Servant leadership. I believe in empowering the team, leading by example, and stepping in when needed. I mentor juniors by pairing, help unblock issues quickly, and set clear expectations.
Leadership, to me, is about **consistency, accountability, and clarity**—not about being loud, but about being dependable.

---

### **D6. Tell me about a mistake you made and how you handled it.**

**Answer (STAR):**
**Situation:** I once pushed a frontend feature that passed QA but failed in production due to timezone inconsistencies.
**Action:** I took responsibility, rolled back quickly, added unit tests for edge timezones, and documented the fix.
**Result:** The issue was resolved within 3 hours, and I later proposed a timezone-handling guideline that became part of our code review checklist.

---

### **D7. How do you mentor junior developers?**

**Answer:**
I pair with them, explain not just what to do but why. I give feedback early, share resources, and build their confidence through small wins.
I also encourage them to demo their work, which boosts their ownership and communication skills.

---

### **D8. What does ownership mean to you?**

**Answer:**
It means owning the outcome—not just your code. I ensure my tasks align with the user impact, test thoroughly, help others when needed, and raise flags early.
In one project, I noticed an integration failure that wasn’t in my scope, but I jumped in, debugged it, and fixed the config—because the user impact was mine to own.

---

### **D9. Describe your experience working in Agile.**

**Answer:**
I’ve worked in 2-week sprints with daily standups, backlog grooming, and retros. I make sure to break down stories clearly, give early demos, and collaborate with QA from the start.
My velocity is consistent because I plan well and buffer for unknowns, especially in frontend-heavy sprints.

---

### **D10. Where do you see yourself in 3–5 years?**

**Answer:**
I see myself as a **Principal Engineer or Tech Lead**, designing scalable architectures, mentoring teams, and aligning technology with business goals.
I also aim to contribute to open-source and drive internal developer experience initiatives in the organization I work with.

**Answer:**
I prioritize clearly, break down the problem, and ask for early feedback. I’ve often delivered under pressure by focusing on what’s **critical vs nice-to-have**, communicating clearly, and working closely with QA for faster cycles.
And I always ensure quality doesn’t suffer.

---

### **D12. Have you ever disagreed with your manager?**

**Answer:**
Yes, I disagreed on pushing an incomplete feature for a demo. I respectfully explained the risks, showed potential production impact, and suggested a quick mock instead.
He agreed after seeing the data. I believe respectful disagreement backed by reasoning is a sign of trust.

---

### **D13. What motivates you?**

**Answer:**
Solving real problems that impact users, learning new technologies, and seeing my solutions used by thousands.
Also, being part of a collaborative, outcome-driven team keeps me motivated every day.

---

### **D14. How do you stay updated with new technologies?**

**Answer:**
I follow blogs (like Baeldung, Medium, InfoQ), watch YouTube channels (Fireship, Tech Primers), take Udemy courses, and actively contribute to small projects to stay hands-on.
I also learn a lot by teaching—mentoring and writing internal documentation.

---

### **D15. Any questions for us?** *(Prepare 2–3 from this list)*

* How does your team ensure code quality and collaboration across frontend and backend?

Let me know if you want me to:

* Create a **mock interview script** with Anant Raman’s style,
* Summarize all 4 Sets (A–D) in a printable PDF/Notion format,
* Help you record/prepare voice or delivery for these answers.

Ready for Set E (if there’s more), or should we focus on mock drills now?

Great! Let’s start with **Set E – DevOps & CI/CD**. These answers are crafted to help you **remember and deliver with confidence** in the interview — like a pro.

---

## 🚀 **Set E: DevOps & CI/CD – Answers**

---

### **1. What’s your experience with CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)?**

> I’ve worked extensively with **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions** to automate build, test, and deploy pipelines. For example, in one project, I configured Jenkins with Maven and SonarQube to run unit tests and code quality checks, then deploy to AWS. In another, I used GitHub Actions to automate Docker-based deployments to staging after pull requests were merged.

🧠 **Tip to remember**: Think in terms of tool + pipeline + result (automation, quality, speed).

---

### **2. How do you implement zero-downtime deployment?**

> I implement zero-downtime deployments using **blue-green** or **canary deployment** strategies. In Kubernetes-based systems, I use rolling updates with health checks, readiness probes, and traffic shifting. We also decouple config using environment variables and use feature flags to turn features on/off without downtime.

🧠 **Visual cue**: Imagine a switchboard — traffic shifts smoothly from blue to green.

---

### **3. How do you monitor app health in production?**

> I monitor app health using **Prometheus + Grafana**, and application logs via **ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**. We also set up alerts through tools like PagerDuty and Slack for real-time issue detection. Health checks, response times, error rates, and database performance are key metrics I track.

🧠 **Framework**: Think **Metrics + Logging + Alerting** = health visibility.

---

### **4. What tools have you used for logging and monitoring?**

> I’ve used:

* **ELK Stack** for log aggregation and searching.
* **Prometheus + Grafana** for time-series metrics and dashboards.
* **New Relic** and **Datadog** in past projects for APM and server metrics.
  Each tool helped uncover performance bottlenecks and catch errors early.

🧠 **Mnemonic**: "Every Project Needs Logs" – ELK, Prometheus, New Relic, Datadog.

---

### **5. How do you perform rollbacks during a bad deployment?**

> For rollbacks, I rely on versioned builds and container tags. If a deployment fails, Jenkins or GitHub Actions reverts to the last stable build. In Kubernetes, I use `kubectl rollout undo`. I also ensure our DB migrations are backward compatible or wrapped in feature toggles.

🧠 **Remember this mantra**: *“Rollback = Tag + State Restore + Toggle Reversal”*

---
