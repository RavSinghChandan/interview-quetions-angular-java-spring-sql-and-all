Perfect ðŸ™Œ Now we move to **Section 5 â†’ JVM & Memory**.
Hereâ€™s the **complete `.md` file content (Java 1 â†’ Java 23)** for you to copy-paste into your master handbook.

# ðŸ“˜ Java JVM & Memory Evolution (Java 1 â†’ Java 23)

This document covers the **JVM internals, memory management, and garbage collection** from **Java 1 (1996) to Java 23 (2025)**.  

---

## ðŸ—‚ JVM & Memory Topics
1. JVM Architecture  
2. Garbage Collectors  
3. JIT Compiler  
4. ClassLoader  
5. Memory Areas (Heap, Stack, Metaspace)  

---

# 1. JVM Architecture

### Java 1 (1996)
- JVM designed to provide **Write Once, Run Anywhere**.  
- Components: **ClassLoader**, **Execution Engine**, **Runtime Data Areas**, **Native Interfaces**.  

### Java 2 (1998)
- HotSpot JVM introduced â†’ adaptive optimization + better performance.  

### Java 5 (2004)
- Instrumentation API introduced (agents for monitoring JVM).  

### Java 9 (2017)
- **Modules** (`java.base`) changed JVM class loading architecture.  

### Java 17+ (2021â€“23)
- Strong encapsulation of JDK internals.  

---

# 2. Garbage Collectors

### Java 1â€“4
- Basic GC with stop-the-world mark-sweep-compact.  

### Java 5 (2004)
- **Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS)** collector introduced.  

### Java 7 (2011)
- **G1 Garbage Collector** added (low pause, region-based).  

### Java 9 (2017)
- **G1 GC became default** replacing CMS.  

### Java 11 (2018)
- **Epsilon GC** (no-op GC) introduced â†’ for testing.  
- **ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)** experimental (low-latency, scalable).  

### Java 15 (2020)
- **Shenandoah GC** (low-pause collector) integrated.  

### Java 17 (2021 LTS)
- ZGC and Shenandoah fully supported + improved scalability.  

### Java 21 (2023 LTS)
- Further performance improvements for ZGC.  

---

# 3. JIT Compiler

### Java 1 (1996)
- Bytecode interpreted â†’ slow performance.  

### Java 1.2 (1998)
- **JIT compiler** in HotSpot JVM â†’ compiles hot methods to native code.  

### Java 7 (2011)
- **Tiered Compilation** introduced (mix of C1 client + C2 server JIT).  

### Java 9 (2017)
- JVMCI (JVM Compiler Interface) introduced â†’ allows alternative compilers like Graal.  

### Java 10 (2018)
- **Graal JIT compiler** included as an experimental feature.  

### Java 17 (2021 LTS)
- GraalVM became popular â†’ polyglot execution beyond Java.  

---

# 4. ClassLoader

### Java 1 (1996)
- ClassLoader hierarchy: **Bootstrap â†’ Extension â†’ Application**.  

### Java 2 (1998)
- Custom ClassLoaders became common for frameworks (e.g., servlet containers).  

### Java 9 (2017)
- **Module system** impacted class loading â†’ `PlatformClassLoader` introduced.  
- Strong encapsulation of internal APIs.  

---

# 5. Memory Areas

### Java 1 (1996)
- Runtime areas: **Heap, Method Area, Stack, PC Register, Native Method Stack**.  

### Java 1.2â€“7
- **Permanent Generation (PermGen)** used for class metadata.  

### Java 8 (2014)
- **PermGen removed â†’ replaced by Metaspace** (native memory based).  

### Java 9 (2017)
- Memory layout improvements for string storage (Compact Strings).  

### Java 11â€“17
- Improvements to Metaspace garbage collection + reduced footprint.  

### Java 21â€“23
- Continuing refinements in memory management â†’ especially for **Valhalla value objects** & **virtual threads stack storage**.

# âœ… Summary

- **JVM Architecture** evolved from a simple interpreter â†’ to HotSpot with JIT, Graal, and modules.  
- **Garbage Collection**:  
  - Java 5: CMS,  
  - Java 7: G1,  
  - Java 9+: G1 default,  
  - Java 11+: ZGC, Epsilon,  
  - Java 15+: Shenandoah,  
  - Java 17+: Low-pause scalable GCs.  
- **Memory Areas**: PermGen â†’ Metaspace (Java 8).  
- **JIT**: Tiered Compilation + Graal â†’ high-performance code execution.  
- **ClassLoader**: Became more modular and secure with Java 9+.  

Java today has a **highly optimized runtime** that balances **performance, scalability, and low-latency** GC, making it competitive for enterprise and cloud-native workloads.

âœ… This is the **entire Section 5 (JVM & Memory)** in one `.md` file.

Would you like me to now move to **Section 6 (Java I/O & Networking)** and prepare it in the same style?
