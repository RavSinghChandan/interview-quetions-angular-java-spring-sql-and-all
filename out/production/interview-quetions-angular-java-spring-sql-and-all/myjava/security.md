Great üëç Let‚Äôs move to **Section 8 ‚Üí Security**.
Here‚Äôs the **complete `.md` file (Java 1 ‚Üí Java 23)** for you to copy-paste directly into your master handbook.

# üìò Java Security Evolution (Java 1 ‚Üí Java 23)

This document covers the **Security features in Java** from **Java 1 (1996) to Java 23 (2025)**.  

---

## üóÇ Security Topics
1. Security Manager  
2. Cryptography APIs  
3. TLS/HTTPS

# 1. Security Manager

### Java 1 (1996)
- Introduced **Security Manager** and permission model.  
- Used heavily for **Applets** (sandboxed execution).  

### Java 2 (1998)
- Introduced **fine-grained permission checks** (file access, network, properties).  

### Java 6‚Äì8
- Widely used in enterprise apps to restrict permissions.  

### Java 9 (2017)
- Strong encapsulation via modules improved internal API security.  

### Java 17 (2021 LTS)
- **Security Manager deprecated** for removal.  
- Reason: Rarely used in modern apps, better alternatives exist.  

### Java 18‚Äì23
- Shift towards **container & OS-level sandboxing** ‚Üí Security Manager considered obsolete.

# 2. Cryptography APIs

### Java 1.1 (1997)
- Introduced **Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)**.  
- Supported message digests (MD5, SHA-1), signatures, key management.  

### Java 1.2 (1998)
- **Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)** added for stronger encryption (DES, AES).  

### Java 5 (2004)
- Better **key management APIs**.  

### Java 6‚Äì7
- Expanded algorithms: AES, RSA, PKCS#11 provider.  

### Java 8 (2014)
- TLS 1.2 default, stronger algorithms (SHA-256).  

### Java 9 (2017)
- Enhanced crypto providers with modularization.  

### Java 11 (2018 LTS)
- TLS 1.3 supported.  
- Stronger defaults: SHA-256 certificates required.  

### Java 17‚Äì23
- Continuous updates for stronger ciphers, removal of weak ones (MD5, SHA-1).  
- Post-quantum crypto research integrations ongoing.  

---

# 3. TLS/HTTPS

### Java 1‚Äì4
- Basic SSL support in `javax.net.ssl`.  

### Java 5‚Äì6
- JSSE (Java Secure Socket Extension) integrated.  

### Java 8 (2014)
- TLS 1.2 default protocol.  

### Java 11 (2018)
- **Modern HTTP Client** supported TLS 1.3.  

### Java 17 (2021)
- Default secure configurations hardened.  

### Java 21‚Äì23
- Continuous TLS improvements for compliance with latest standards.

# ‚úÖ Summary

- **Security Manager**: Introduced in Java 1 for sandboxing, deprecated in Java 17+ (obsolete in cloud/container era).  
- **Cryptography APIs**: Evolved from MD5/SHA-1 to strong AES, RSA, TLS 1.3, SHA-256+. Weak algorithms phased out.  
- **TLS/HTTPS**: Modernized via HTTP Client (Java 11+) with default secure settings.  

Java security moved from **application-level sandboxing (1990s)** ‚Üí to **cryptography APIs & TLS standards** ‚Üí to **modern cloud/container security (2020s)**, aligning with today‚Äôs best practices.

‚úÖ This is the **entire Section 8 (Security)** in one `.md` file.

Would you like me to continue with **Section 9 (APIs & Utilities)** next in the same format?
