Perfect ðŸ‘Œ Now letâ€™s complete the last one: **Section 10 â†’ Tooling & Ecosystem**.
Hereâ€™s the **complete `.md` file (Java 1 â†’ Java 23)** ready to copy-paste into your handbook.

# ðŸ“˜ Java Tooling & Ecosystem Evolution (Java 1 â†’ Java 23)

This document covers the **Java tools and ecosystem support** from **Java 1 (1996) to Java 23 (2025)**.  

---

## ðŸ—‚ Tooling & Ecosystem Topics
1. JShell  
2. Javadoc Improvements  
3. Deprecations & Module System  

---

# 1. JShell

### Before Java 9
- No REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) available. Developers relied on IDEs or scripts.  

### Java 9 (2017)
- **JShell introduced** â€“ Javaâ€™s interactive REPL tool.  
- Allowed experimenting with code snippets quickly.  
```bash
jshell> int x = 10
x ==> 10
````

### Java 11â€“23

* Continuous refinements â†’ better integration with APIs & usability improvements.

---

# 2. Javadoc Improvements

### Java 1 (1996)

* `javadoc` tool introduced â†’ HTML documentation from comments.

### Java 5 (2004)

* Added support for **annotations in Javadoc**.

### Java 8 (2014)

* Search feature added in generated docs.
* Default documentation became HTML5.

### Java 9 (2017)

* Javadoc integrated with **modules**.
* Added **@uses, @provides** tags for modular documentation.

### Java 10â€“23

* Continuous improvements, better navigation, index pages, and security documentation.

---

# 3. Deprecations & Module System

### Java 1â€“8

* APIs deprecated gradually with `@Deprecated`.

### Java 9 (2017)

* **Module System (Project Jigsaw)** introduced.
* Core JDK divided into modules (`java.base`, `java.sql`, etc.).
* Deprecated and removed many old/unsafe APIs.

### Java 11 (2018)

* Removed **Java EE (JAXB, JAX-WS)** and **CORBA** modules from JDK.

### Java 17 (2021 LTS)

* Strong encapsulation of internal APIs (e.g., `sun.misc.Unsafe` blocked by default).

### Java 21â€“23

* Modules + encapsulation further strengthened.
* Deprecated Security Manager fully phased out.

# âœ… Summary

* **JShell**: Added in Java 9 â†’ makes Java friendlier for learning and experimentation.
* **Javadoc**: Evolved from basic HTML docs â†’ to fully searchable, HTML5, and modular documentation.
* **Deprecations & Modules**: Old APIs gradually removed, JDK modularized in Java 9, and modernized for security + maintainability.

Javaâ€™s ecosystem now emphasizes **modularity, strong documentation, and modern tooling** to keep the language clean and developer-friendly.

âœ… This is the **entire Section 10 (Tooling & Ecosystem)** in one `.md` file.  

ðŸŽ‰ That completes all **10 sections** â€” you now have a **full Java Evolution Handbook (Java 1 â†’ 23)** broken into `.md` chapters.  

Would you like me to now **merge all 10 sections into a single giant `.md` file** so you can keep one consolidated handbook?
