Great. We start with **STEP 1 — design-thinking.md**.
Study this deeply. This file is the *foundation of all LLD*. Every strong senior candidate masters this before touching classes or code.

---


# STEP 1 — DESIGN THINKING (LLD FOUNDATION)

This file builds your core design brain.
LLD interviews are not about syntax.
They test how you think.

If this step is strong → entire interview becomes easy.

---

# 1️⃣ WHAT INTERVIEWERS ACTUALLY TEST

They are NOT testing:
- syntax
- memorized patterns
- frameworks

They ARE testing:
- structured thinking
- abstraction ability
- problem decomposition
- engineering maturity
- decision making

Your goal:
Think like a system designer, not a coder.

---

# 2️⃣ THE GOLDEN DESIGN RULE

Never start coding first.

Always start with:
UNDERSTANDING → MODELING → DESIGN → IMPLEMENTATION

Candidates who jump to classes early fail.

---

# 3️⃣ REQUIREMENT CLARIFICATION FRAMEWORK

First thing you must do in interview:

Ask clarifying questions.

Divide requirements into:

### Functional Requirements
What system must do.

Example:
- user can book ticket
- user can cancel ticket

---

### Non-Functional Requirements
How system must behave.

Example:
- performance
- scalability
- concurrency
- reliability
- security

---

### Constraints
Always ask:

- expected scale?
- read heavy or write heavy?
- latency expectations?
- consistency needs?

Senior signal:
Candidates who ask constraints are seen as real engineers.

---

# 4️⃣ PROBLEM DECOMPOSITION SKILL

Break system into parts:

System → Modules → Components → Classes → Methods

Interviewers want to see:
Can you split complexity into manageable parts?

---

# 5️⃣ ENTITY IDENTIFICATION METHOD

Ask:

What are the real-world objects in this system?

Example (Food Delivery):

Entities:
- User
- Restaurant
- Order
- DeliveryAgent
- Payment

Rule:
Entities become classes.

---

# 6️⃣ RESPONSIBILITY ASSIGNMENT

For each entity ask:

What is this responsible for?

Example:

Order should:
- track status
- calculate price

Order should NOT:
- send notifications
- process payment

That belongs elsewhere.

Golden Principle:
Each class should have ONE reason to change.

---

# 7️⃣ DOMAIN MODELING (SENIOR SKILL)

Junior → writes classes  
Senior → models domain

Domain modeling includes:

- business rules
- invariants
- constraints
- workflows
- states

Example invariant:
Order cannot be delivered before shipped.

Your class must enforce that.

---

# 8️⃣ STATE THINKING

Every real system has states.

Example Order States:
CREATED → PAID → SHIPPED → DELIVERED → CANCELLED

Design must enforce valid transitions.

Interviewer signal:
Mentioning state transitions = strong hire signal.

---

# 9️⃣ EDGE CASE THINKING

Always ask:

What could go wrong?

Examples:
- invalid input
- duplicate request
- timeout
- partial failure
- retry
- concurrency conflict

Senior candidates mention edge cases BEFORE interviewer asks.

---

# 🔟 ABSTRACTION SKILL

Abstraction means:

Hide unnecessary detail.

Example:

Bad:
PaymentViaUPIClass
PaymentViaCardClass
PaymentViaWalletClass

Good:
PaymentStrategy interface

Abstraction = extensibility.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ ASSUMPTION DECLARATION

If requirement missing → state assumption.

Example:
"I’ll assume system supports up to 10k users concurrently."

This shows maturity.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ TRADEOFF THINKING

Every design decision has tradeoffs.

You must speak them.

Example:
HashMap fast lookup but unordered.

TreeMap slower but sorted.

Senior engineers don’t just choose.
They justify.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ DESIGN ITERATION MINDSET

Real systems evolve.

Say this in interview:

"Let’s design basic version first, then improve."

Interviewers LOVE iterative thinking.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ FAILURE AWARENESS

Real systems fail.

Always design for:

- network failure
- retry
- timeout
- fallback
- partial success

Senior signal:
Mentioning failure scenarios.

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ SCALABILITY AWARENESS (AT DESIGN LEVEL)

Even in LLD you should mention:

- caching hooks
- stateless components
- async operations
- batching
- pooling

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ TESTABILITY THINKING

Every class should be testable.

Ask:
Can this be mocked?
Can logic be isolated?
Are dependencies injectable?

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ MAINTAINABILITY THINKING

Code lives for years.

Design should support:
- change
- debugging
- monitoring
- extension

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ SENIOR DESIGN MINDSET

Mid engineer asks:
How do I implement this?

Senior engineer asks:
How will this evolve in 2 years?

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ INTERVIEW OPENING TEMPLATE

Always start like this:

"Let me clarify requirements first.
Then I’ll identify entities.
Then define responsibilities.
Then design interactions."

This instantly signals structure.

---

# 2️⃣0️⃣ FINAL DESIGN CHECKLIST

Before finishing design verify:

✔ requirements covered  
✔ extensible  
✔ thread safe  
✔ testable  
✔ failure aware  
✔ scalable  
✔ readable  

---

# 🏆 MASTER PRINCIPLE

Low Level Design = Structured thinking + clean modeling + future proofing.

---

# 🎯 WHAT TO PRACTICE AFTER THIS FILE

Practice thinking exercises:

Pick any system and ask:
- entities?
- responsibilities?
- states?
- edge cases?
- failure points?

Do this daily.

---

# FINAL MINDSET

The strongest candidates are not the smartest.

They are the most structured thinkers.
```
