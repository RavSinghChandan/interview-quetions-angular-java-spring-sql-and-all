Great. Now we move into the phase where most candidates start struggling and senior engineers stand out:

> **Object Collaboration Design**

This step teaches you how objects actually **talk to each other**, execute logic, and complete workflows.
Interviewers watch this part very carefully because this reveals whether you can design **real executable systems**, not just diagrams.

# STEP 10 — OBJECT COLLABORATION (INTERACTION DESIGN)

Entities + Relationships ≠ Working System

A system only works when objects collaborate correctly.

This step teaches how to design that collaboration.

---

# 1️⃣ WHAT IS OBJECT COLLABORATION?

It is the flow of communication between objects to complete a task.

Example:

User places order

Flow:
Controller → Service → Order → Payment → Notification

This chain is collaboration.

---

# 2️⃣ WHY INTERVIEWERS CARE

Because collaboration reveals:

- system understanding
- execution thinking
- real-world experience
- architecture clarity

Anyone can draw classes.
Few can design interactions.

---

# 3️⃣ COLLABORATION DESIGN ORDER

Always design interactions after:

Entities → Responsibilities → Relationships

Never before.

---

# 4️⃣ THE COLLABORATION QUESTION

For any action ask:

Which object starts the process?
Who handles logic?
Who validates?
Who stores?
Who responds?

Answering this defines flow.

---

# 5️⃣ CONTROL FLOW VS DATA FLOW

You must distinguish both.

Control Flow:
Who calls whom.

Data Flow:
What data moves.

Senior engineers clarify both.

---

# 6️⃣ MESSAGE PASSING PRINCIPLE

Objects communicate using messages (method calls).

Example:

order.calculateTotal()

Not:
externalUtil.calculate(order)

Behavior belongs inside object.

---

# 7️⃣ SEQUENCE THINKING (CRITICAL SKILL)

Mentally simulate execution.

Ask:

Step 1 → What happens?
Step 2 → Who handles it?
Step 3 → What changes?
Step 4 → What returns?

This is what interviewers test.

---

# 8️⃣ COLLABORATION DIAGRAM TECHNIQUE

Draw arrows while explaining.

Example:

Controller → Service → Repository

Arrows show interaction.

This visually proves structured thinking.

---

# 9️⃣ SINGLE FLOW OWNERSHIP RULE

One object should coordinate flow.

Usually:

Service layer.

Avoid:

Multiple objects calling each other randomly.

That causes chaos.

---

# 🔟 METHOD RESPONSIBILITY RULE

Method should:

- do one thing
- delegate when needed
- not call too many objects

If method talks to 5+ objects → bad design.

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ INTERACTION ANTI-PATTERNS

Avoid these:

- circular calls
- deep call chains
- unnecessary calls
- tight dependency chain

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ CHATTER PROBLEM

Too many back-and-forth calls between objects.

Bad:

A → B → A → B → A → B

Good:
One clear direction.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ COLLABORATION LAYERING

Correct interaction flow:

Controller → Service → Domain → Repository

Never:

Controller → Repository directly

That breaks architecture.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ DOMAIN OWNERSHIP RULE

Business logic should live in domain objects.

Service should coordinate.

Wrong:
Service calculates price.

Correct:
Order calculates price.

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ TRANSACTION BOUNDARY THINKING

Ask:
Where should operation be atomic?

Example:

Place order:
- reserve inventory
- charge payment
- create order

Should be transaction-safe.

Senior candidates mention this.

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ FAILURE FLOW DESIGN

Ask:

If step fails → what happens?

Example:

Payment fails → cancel order.

Design failure path too.

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ ASYNC VS SYNC INTERACTION

Ask:

Should call be blocking?

Use async when:
- slow operations
- external services
- background jobs

Mentioning async = senior signal.

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ COLLABORATION VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finishing interaction design verify:

✔ flow logical  
✔ no circular calls  
✔ clear entry point  
✔ clear ownership  
✔ failure handled  
✔ minimal calls  

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ REAL INTERVIEW EXAMPLE

Design Ride Booking

Interaction:

UserController.bookRide()

→ RideService
→ DriverMatcher
→ PricingService
→ PaymentService
→ NotificationService

Clear linear flow.

---

# 2️⃣0️⃣ SENIOR DESIGN INSIGHT

Bad candidates describe classes.

Strong candidates simulate execution.

---

# 🏆 INTERVIEW POWER SENTENCE

Say:

"Let’s walk through request flow step by step."

Interviewers LOVE this.

---

# 🎯 PRACTICE DRILL

Pick system: Food Delivery

Simulate:

Place Order flow

Write step-by-step execution.

Do daily.

---

# FINAL PRINCIPLE

Classes define structure.

Collaboration defines behavior.

Real systems succeed because of good collaboration design.
```

This is a very high-signal topic. Senior candidates always define APIs before coding because APIs define system boundaries.
