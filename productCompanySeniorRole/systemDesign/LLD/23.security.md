Excellent. Now we cover a topic that **instantly distinguishes senior engineers** in interviews:

> **Security-Aware Design**

Most candidates ignore security.
Senior engineers automatically consider it while designing systems.

Even a few security mentions during LLD can dramatically increase interviewer confidence.

Study this carefully.

---

# STEP 23 — SECURITY (PRODUCTION-GRADE SYSTEM SAFETY)

Security is not an add-on feature.

Security is a design requirement.

If your design ignores security,
it is incomplete.

---

# 1️⃣ WHY SECURITY MATTERS

Security failures cause:

- data leaks
- financial loss
- legal issues
- system compromise
- reputation damage

Real companies prioritize security heavily.

Senior engineers must think about it.

---

# 2️⃣ SECURITY DESIGN PRINCIPLE

Always assume:

System is under attack.

Design defensively.

---

# 3️⃣ CORE SECURITY AREAS

You must always consider:

Authentication  
Authorization  
Input Validation  
Encryption  
Rate Limiting  
Audit Logging  

These form security baseline.

---

---

# 4️⃣ AUTHENTICATION

Question:
Who is the user?

Common methods:

- password login
- OAuth
- tokens
- API keys
- biometrics

Authentication verifies identity.

---

---

# 5️⃣ AUTHORIZATION

Question:
What is user allowed to do?

Example:

User can:
view account

But cannot:
delete other users

Authorization controls permissions.

---

---

# 6️⃣ PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE

Users and services should have:

minimum permissions required.

Never give full access.

This reduces damage if compromised.

---

---

# 7️⃣ INPUT VALIDATION

All external input must be validated.

Never trust client input.

Validate:

- type
- length
- format
- range
- encoding

Prevents:

SQL injection
XSS
malformed data

---

---

# 8️⃣ ENCRYPTION

Sensitive data must be encrypted.

Two types:

Data in transit → TLS/HTTPS  
Data at rest → encrypted storage  

Mentioning both shows maturity.

---

---

# 9️⃣ TOKEN-BASED SECURITY

Modern systems use tokens instead of sessions.

Examples:

JWT
OAuth tokens

Benefits:

- stateless
- scalable
- secure

---

---

# 🔟 RATE LIMITING FOR SECURITY

Rate limiting prevents:

- brute force attacks
- API abuse
- spam requests

Mentioning rate limiting shows production thinking.

---

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ SECURE PASSWORD STORAGE

Never store passwords in plain text.

Always:

hash + salt

Example algorithms:

bcrypt
argon2

---

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ SECRETS MANAGEMENT

Sensitive values must never be hardcoded.

Examples:

API keys
DB passwords
tokens

Store in:

secure vault
secret manager
env variables

---

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ AUDIT LOGGING

Security systems must log:

who did what
when
from where

Audit logs help:

- detect attacks
- investigate issues
- ensure compliance

---

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ DEFENSE IN DEPTH

Security should exist at multiple layers.

Example layers:

API gateway
service layer
database
network

Even if one layer fails → others protect.

---

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ COMMON ATTACK TYPES (INTERVIEW BONUS)

Mentioning these impresses interviewers:

SQL Injection  
XSS  
CSRF  
Replay attacks  
Brute force  

You don’t need deep details.
Just awareness.

---

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ SECURE API DESIGN

Secure APIs must:

- authenticate requests
- validate inputs
- enforce authorization
- rate limit
- log activity

---

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ DATA EXPOSURE RULE

Never expose sensitive data unnecessarily.

Example:

User API should not return:

password
SSN
private tokens

---

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ REAL INTERVIEW EXAMPLE

Design Payment System

Security considerations:

- encrypted payment data
- tokenized card numbers
- auth before transaction
- audit logs
- fraud detection

Candidate mentioning these stands out.

---

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ SECURITY CHECKLIST

Before finishing design verify:

✔ authentication present  
✔ authorization enforced  
✔ input validated  
✔ sensitive data encrypted  
✔ secrets protected  
✔ logs recorded  

---

---

# 2️⃣0️⃣ SENIOR INSIGHT

Junior engineers build features.

Senior engineers protect systems.

---

---

# 🏆 INTERVIEW POWER SENTENCE

Say:

"We should validate inputs and enforce authorization to secure this endpoint."

This instantly signals production awareness.

---

---

# 🎯 PRACTICE DRILL

Pick system daily:

Add security layer for:

- API
- database
- user actions

Practice until automatic.

---

---

# FINAL PRINCIPLE

Secure systems are designed.

Not patched later.
```
