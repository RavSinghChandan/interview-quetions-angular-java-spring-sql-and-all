Perfect. Now we enter one of the **most important senior-filter topics** in LLD interviews:

> **Responsibility Assignment**

Most candidates fail here because they put logic in the wrong classes.
Senior engineers shine here.

Study this deeply.

# STEP 3 — RESPONSIBILITY ASSIGNMENT (DESIGN INTELLIGENCE)

This file teaches:
Where logic should live.

Most candidates fail LLD because they misplace responsibilities.

Interviewers watch carefully:
Do you assign logic correctly?

This is a strong signal of real-world experience.

---

# 1️⃣ CORE PRINCIPLE

Classes are not containers.
They are responsibility holders.

Every class must answer:
"What is my job?"

If you cannot answer → class shouldn’t exist.

---

# 2️⃣ GOLDEN RULE

Behavior should live where data lives.

Example:

Bad:
PaymentService.calculateOrderTotal(order)

Good:
Order.calculateTotal()

Why?
Because Order owns order data.

---

# 3️⃣ SRP AT SYSTEM LEVEL

Single Responsibility applies not just to methods, but system structure.

Wrong:
UserManager handles:
- login
- payment
- profile
- notifications

Correct:
Separate services.

---

# 4️⃣ RESPONSIBILITY IDENTIFICATION METHOD

For each entity ask:

1. What data does it own?
2. What actions can it perform on that data?
3. What rules must it enforce?

Those become its responsibilities.

---

# 5️⃣ INFORMATION EXPERT PRINCIPLE (INTERVIEW GOLD)

Assign responsibility to class that has required data.

Example:

Who should calculate order price?

Options:
- Order
- PaymentService
- User

Correct:
Order

Because Order has items.

---

# 6️⃣ CONTROLLER PRINCIPLE

System operations should be handled by controller-like class.

Example:
BookingController handles booking request.

Controller should:
- orchestrate calls
- not contain business logic

---

# 7️⃣ CREATOR PRINCIPLE

Who creates an object?

Rule:
Class that uses or owns object should create it.

Example:
Order creates OrderItem

Not:
ExternalFactoryRandomClass

---

# 8️⃣ LOW COUPLING PRINCIPLE

Assign responsibility in way that reduces dependencies.

Bad:
PaymentService depends on 7 classes.

Good:
PaymentService depends on PaymentInterface only.

---

# 9️⃣ HIGH COHESION PRINCIPLE

Each class should do closely related tasks.

Bad:
Order class:
- calculates price
- sends email
- logs metrics
- writes DB

Good:
Split responsibilities.

---

# 🔟 SERVICE VS DOMAIN RESPONSIBILITY

Domain Object:
Owns rules.

Service:
Coordinates workflow.

Example:

Domain:
Order.validate()

Service:
OrderService.placeOrder()

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ WRONG RESPONSIBILITY SMELLS

If you see these → design mistake

- class has "Manager" in name and does everything
- utility class with 100 methods
- one class calling every other class
- giant service class

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ "GOD CLASS" ANTI-PATTERN

God Class signs:

- huge file
- many methods
- too many dependencies
- knows everything

Interviewers reject instantly.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ DISTRIBUTED RESPONSIBILITY THINKING

Responsibilities should be spread logically.

Not centralized.

Bad:
MainService does everything.

Good:
Small focused components.

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ METHOD PLACEMENT RULE

When deciding where method belongs ask:

Which class owns the data needed?

That class should own method.

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ LAW OF DEMETER (RESPONSIBILITY VERSION)

Class should only talk to:

- itself
- its fields
- method parameters

Avoid:

a.getB().getC().doWork()

This indicates wrong responsibility placement.

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ CHANGE IMPACT TEST

Ask:
"If requirement changes, which class should change?"

If answer:
"Many classes"

→ bad design.

Goal:
Change affects only one class.

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ REAL INTERVIEW EXAMPLE

Question:
Where should discount logic go?

Wrong answers:
PaymentService
Controller
UI

Correct:
Pricing or Order class

Because they own pricing rules.

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ RESPONSIBILITY LAYERING MODEL

Layered assignment:

Controller → request handling  
Service → workflow logic  
Domain → business rules  
Repository → data persistence  

Mixing layers = bad design.

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ RESPONSIBILITY VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finalizing design check:

✔ Does each class have single purpose?  
✔ Does class own its logic?  
✔ Any logic in wrong class?  
✔ Any class doing too much?  
✔ Any missing responsibility class?  

---

# 2️⃣0️⃣ SENIOR DESIGN INSIGHT

Bad engineers design classes.
Good engineers assign responsibilities.
Great engineers design responsibility boundaries.

---

# 🏆 INTERVIEW POWER LINE

Say this while designing:

"I want to place this logic inside this class because it owns the data and rule."

Interviewers immediately recognize maturity.

---

# 🎯 PRACTICE EXERCISE

Pick system: Food Delivery

Assign responsibilities for:

- Order
- Payment
- Restaurant
- DeliveryAgent

Practice daily until automatic.

---

# FINAL PRINCIPLE

Correct responsibility placement
= clean architecture
= easy scaling
= maintainable system
= strong interview performance
```
