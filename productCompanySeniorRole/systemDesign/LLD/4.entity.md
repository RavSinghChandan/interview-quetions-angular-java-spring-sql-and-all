Excellent. Now we enter the **core modeling skill** that separates average engineers from real system designers:

> **Entity Identification**

If you master this step, your designs instantly look structured and senior-level.

Study slowly and visualize while reading.

# STEP 4 — ENTITY IDENTIFICATION (SYSTEM MODELING CORE)

This step teaches:
How to discover the correct building blocks of a system.

Entities are the backbone of LLD.

If entities are wrong → entire design collapses.

---

# 1️⃣ WHAT IS AN ENTITY?

Entity = Real-world object with:

- identity
- state
- behavior

Examples:

User  
Order  
Car  
Account  
Ticket  

Entities usually become classes.

---

# 2️⃣ WHY ENTITY IDENTIFICATION MATTERS

Interviewers judge you instantly based on your entity list.

Strong candidates:
identify correct entities fast.

Weak candidates:
start coding without modeling.

---

# 3️⃣ GOLDEN IDENTIFICATION QUESTION

Always ask:

"What real-world things exist in this system?"

Not:
"What classes should I create?"

---

# 4️⃣ STEP-BY-STEP ENTITY DISCOVERY METHOD

Follow this sequence:

Step 1 — Read problem carefully  
Step 2 — Highlight nouns  
Step 3 — Filter important nouns  
Step 4 — Convert them to entities  

---

Example:
Design Library System

Nouns:
User, Book, Author, Issue, Return, Fine, Librarian

Entities:
User
Book
Loan
Fine

Not entities:
Return (action)
Issue (action)

---

# 5️⃣ ENTITY VS ACTION (COMMON MISTAKE)

Wrong:
Create class for every word.

Rule:

Objects → Entities  
Actions → Methods  

Example:

Payment = entity  
Pay = method  

---

# 6️⃣ ENTITY TYPES (SENIOR LEVEL)

There are 4 types of entities:

---

## Core Entities
Main business objects.

Example:
Order
User
Product

---

## Supporting Entities
Assist main flow.

Example:
Address
PaymentInfo
Metadata

---

## System Entities
Technical helpers.

Example:
Logger
Cache
Queue

---

## Value Objects
Small immutable objects.

Example:
Money
Coordinates
TimeRange

Value objects:
- no identity
- only value

---

# 7️⃣ ENTITY BOUNDARY RULE

Ask:
Where does this entity’s responsibility start and end?

Example:

User should NOT:
process payment

User SHOULD:
store profile info

---

# 8️⃣ ENTITY NAMING RULE

Use business language, not technical names.

Bad:
UserDataProcessorManager

Good:
User
Order
Payment

---

# 9️⃣ ENTITY MINIMALISM PRINCIPLE

Do not create too many entities.

Too many → overengineering  
Too few → god class

Goal:
Balanced modeling.

---

# 🔟 ENTITY RELATIONSHIP THINKING

After identifying entities ask:

How do they connect?

Relationships:

- has-a
- uses-a
- owns-a
- depends-on

Example:
Order has Items

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ ENTITY RESPONSIBILITY TEST

For each entity ask:

"What is it responsible for?"

If answer unclear → entity unnecessary.

---

# 1️⃣2️⃣ ENTITY LIFECYCLE THINKING

Ask:
How is entity created?
How is it updated?
How is it deleted?

Senior signal:
Mentioning lifecycle.

---

# 1️⃣3️⃣ STATEFUL VS STATELESS ENTITIES

Stateful:
Stores changing data.

Example:
Order

Stateless:
Only performs logic.

Example:
Validator

---

# 1️⃣4️⃣ ENTITY VALIDATION RULE

Entities should enforce their own validity.

Example:

Order should prevent:
negative quantity.

Not controller.

---

# 1️⃣5️⃣ ENTITY EXTRACTION PRACTICE

Example:
Design Uber

Entities:

- Rider
- Driver
- Ride
- Location
- Payment

Not entities:
MatchingAlgorithm → service

---

# 1️⃣6️⃣ COMMON INTERVIEW TRAP

Interviewer asks:
"Any other entities?"

They test:
Did you miss edge entities?

Often missed:

- Notification
- Payment
- Status
- History
- Log

Always think of secondary objects.

---

# 1️⃣7️⃣ ENTITY GRANULARITY

Avoid:

Too broad:
SystemManager

Too detailed:
UserNameValidatorFormatter

Choose meaningful abstraction level.

---

# 1️⃣8️⃣ ENTITY REUSE THINKING

Ask:
Can this entity be reused?

Reusable entities indicate good abstraction.

---

# 1️⃣9️⃣ ENTITY DESIGN CHECKLIST

Before finalizing entities confirm:

✔ All real-world objects represented  
✔ No action modeled as class  
✔ No unnecessary classes  
✔ Clear responsibilities  
✔ Correct abstraction level  

---

# 2️⃣0️⃣ SENIOR DESIGN INSIGHT

Strong candidates design classes.

Elite candidates design domain models.

Domain model = structured representation of reality.

---

# 🏆 INTERVIEW POWER SENTENCE

Say this:

"Let me first identify core entities before designing classes."

Instant strong signal.

---

# 🎯 DAILY PRACTICE DRILL

Pick random system daily:

ATM  
Parking Lot  
Spotify  
Airline Booking  

Identify entities in under 60 seconds.

Train this skill until automatic.

---

# FINAL PRINCIPLE

Correct entities → clean design  
Wrong entities → messy system
```
