Perfect — and great instruction.
You’re absolutely right: for **senior-level interviews**, we must cover **ALL GoF design patterns**, not shortcuts.

We’ll now build your notes exactly at **interview-mastery depth**.

# STEP 7 — creational-patterns.md

*(All Creational Patterns — Complete Senior Notes)*


# STEP 7 — CREATIONAL PATTERNS (OBJECT CREATION MASTERY)

Creational patterns solve one core problem:

How objects should be created.

Bad creation logic causes:
- tight coupling
- inflexible code
- hard testing
- duplication

Senior engineers control object creation deliberately.

---

# WHY INTERVIEWERS ASK CREATIONAL PATTERNS

Because they test:

- abstraction ability
- object lifecycle understanding
- dependency management
- architecture thinking

---

# THE 5 CREATIONAL PATTERNS (GOF OFFICIAL)

You must know all deeply:

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype

---

---

# 1️⃣ SINGLETON PATTERN

Purpose:
Ensure only ONE instance exists.

Used for:
- config manager
- logger
- cache
- connection pool

---

Core Idea:
Private constructor + static instance.

---

When to Use
- shared resource
- global state needed
- expensive object creation

---

When NOT to Use
- stateless objects
- test-heavy code
- multithreaded misuse

---

Thread-safe Singleton Variants

Must know for interview:

1. Eager initialization
2. Lazy initialization
3. Double-checked locking
4. Static holder class
5. Enum singleton (best in Java)

---

Interview Insight:
Singleton is often overused.

Mention that.

---

---

# 2️⃣ FACTORY METHOD PATTERN

Purpose:
Create object without exposing creation logic.

Instead of:

new Car()

Use:

VehicleFactory.create()

---

When to Use
- creation logic complex
- type decided at runtime
- decouple client from class

---

Real Example
Notification system:

create("SMS")
create("EMAIL")

---

Interview Power Line
"Factory centralizes creation logic."

---

---

# 3️⃣ ABSTRACT FACTORY PATTERN

Purpose:
Create families of related objects.

Example:

UI Theme Factory:

DarkThemeFactory:
- DarkButton
- DarkMenu

LightThemeFactory:
- LightButton
- LightMenu

---

Difference vs Factory Method

Factory Method → creates ONE object  
Abstract Factory → creates RELATED objects

---

Use When
System must switch entire family of objects.

---

---

# 4️⃣ BUILDER PATTERN

Purpose:
Create complex objects step-by-step.

Used when constructor has many parameters.

Bad:

new User(a,b,c,d,e,f,g)

Good:

UserBuilder()
 .name()
 .email()
 .age()
 .build()

---

Benefits

- readable
- immutable objects
- flexible construction
- optional fields

---

Interview Tip
Mention builder for:

DTOs  
API models  
config objects  

---

---

# 5️⃣ PROTOTYPE PATTERN

Purpose:
Create object by cloning existing one.

Instead of creating from scratch.

Used when:
Object creation expensive.

---

Example

Game objects
UI elements
large configs

---

Benefit

Faster than new construction.

---

---

# CREATIONAL PATTERN SELECTION GUIDE

If problem is…

Only one instance needed → Singleton  
Complex creation → Builder  
Unknown type at runtime → Factory  
Families of objects → Abstract Factory  
Expensive object creation → Prototype  

---

---

# CREATIONAL PATTERN INTERVIEW SIGNALS

Mentioning these makes interviewer think:

"This candidate has real system design experience."

---

---

# COMMON MISTAKES CANDIDATES MAKE

Avoid:

- using Singleton everywhere
- confusing factory vs abstract factory
- using builder for simple objects
- forgetting thread safety
- not explaining when NOT to use

---

---

# ADVANCED SENIOR INSIGHTS

You should be able to answer:

Why Singleton can be dangerous?
→ global state + testing difficulty

Why factory improves maintainability?
→ central creation logic

Why builder preferred in APIs?
→ readability + optional params

---

---

# CREATIONAL PATTERN CHECKLIST

Before finishing design ask:

✔ Is object creation flexible?  
✔ Can type change later?  
✔ Is object expensive?  
✔ Are many parameters involved?  
✔ Do we need families of objects?  

---

---

# INTERVIEW MINI TEMPLATE

If interviewer asks:

"How will you create objects?"

Answer structure:

1. Identify creation problem
2. Pick pattern
3. Justify choice
4. Mention alternative

---

---

# SENIOR DIFFERENTIATOR STATEMENT

Always say:

"I’m choosing this pattern because it keeps creation logic decoupled from business logic."

Instant senior signal.

---

---

# PRACTICE TASK

Design using creational patterns:

- Notification system
- Database connector
- Payment system
- Logger
- UI theme system

---

---

# FINAL PRINCIPLE

Junior engineers create objects.

Senior engineers design creation strategy.
```
