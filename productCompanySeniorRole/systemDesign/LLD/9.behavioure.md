Excellent. Now we enter the **largest and most important pattern section** for senior interviews:

> **Behavioral Patterns — System Logic & Communication Design**

This is where interviewers detect real senior engineers because these patterns define:

* system interaction
* logic orchestration
* communication flow
* decision routing

We will cover **ALL 11 GoF Behavioral Patterns** in full depth.

# STEP 9 — BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS (SYSTEM LOGIC DESIGN)

Behavioral patterns solve:

How objects communicate and collaborate.

If structural patterns define structure,
behavioral patterns define system intelligence.

Senior engineers must master these.

---

# ALL 11 BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS

1. Chain of Responsibility
2. Command
3. Interpreter
4. Iterator
5. Mediator
6. Memento
7. Observer
8. State
9. Strategy
10. Template Method
11. Visitor

---

---

# 1️⃣ CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY

Purpose:
Pass request along chain until handled.

---

Example:
HTTP middleware pipeline

Auth → Logging → Validation → Handler

---

Use When
- multiple handlers possible
- handler unknown beforehand
- pipeline processing needed

---

Senior Insight
Removes giant if-else blocks.

---

---

# 2️⃣ COMMAND PATTERN

Purpose:
Encapsulate request as object.

---

Example:
Remote Control

Command objects:
TurnOnCommand
TurnOffCommand

---

Use Cases
- undo/redo
- task queues
- job scheduling

---

Senior Insight
Command enables request logging and replay.

---

---

# 3️⃣ INTERPRETER PATTERN

Purpose:
Evaluate language grammar.

---

Example:
SQL parser
Regex engine
Expression evaluator

---

Rare in interviews but powerful when parsing logic needed.

---

---

# 4️⃣ ITERATOR PATTERN

Purpose:
Traverse collection without exposing structure.

---

Example:
List iterator

Client doesn’t know internal structure.

---

Used When
Collection implementation may change.

---

---

# 5️⃣ MEDIATOR PATTERN

Purpose:
Central object controls communication.

Instead of objects talking directly.

---

Example:
Air traffic controller.

Planes don’t talk to each other.
They talk to tower.

---

Benefits
- reduces coupling
- simplifies communication
- central coordination

---

---

# 6️⃣ MEMENTO PATTERN

Purpose:
Save and restore object state.

---

Example:
Undo feature
Game save state

---

Used When
Need snapshot + rollback.

---

---

# 7️⃣ OBSERVER PATTERN

Purpose:
Notify multiple listeners automatically.

---

Example:
Event system

Subscribers auto-updated.

---

Used For
- event-driven systems
- pub/sub
- notifications

---

Interview Signal
Observer is extremely commonly used.

---

---

# 8️⃣ STATE PATTERN

Purpose:
Object behavior changes based on state.

---

Example:
Order lifecycle

Created → Paid → Shipped → Delivered

Each state changes allowed actions.

---

Benefits
Removes huge conditional logic.

---

---

# 9️⃣ STRATEGY PATTERN

Purpose:
Switch algorithm dynamically.

---

Example:
Pricing strategy

NormalPricing
FestivalPricing
SurgePricing

---

Used For
Any logic that may vary.

---

Most asked pattern in interviews.

---

---

# 🔟 TEMPLATE METHOD

Purpose:
Define skeleton algorithm in base class.
Subclasses override steps.

---

Example:
Payment processing flow

Steps fixed:
validate → process → notify

Subclasses customize logic.

---

---

# 1️⃣1️⃣ VISITOR PATTERN

Purpose:
Add new operations without modifying classes.

---

Example:
Compiler AST processing.

Visitor applies operations externally.

---

Used When
Object structure stable
Operations change frequently.

---

---

# BEHAVIORAL PATTERN SELECTION GUIDE

If problem is…

Pipeline processing → Chain  
Encapsulated request → Command  
Parsing grammar → Interpreter  
Traversal → Iterator  
Central coordinator → Mediator  
Undo support → Memento  
Event notifications → Observer  
State transitions → State  
Dynamic algorithm → Strategy  
Fixed algorithm skeleton → Template  
New operations frequently → Visitor  

---

---

# MOST IMPORTANT PATTERNS FOR INTERVIEWS

Priority list:

Must Know Deeply:
Strategy  
Observer  
State  
Chain  
Command  

Should Know:
Mediator  
Template  
Iterator  

Advanced:
Visitor  
Memento  
Interpreter  

---

---

# COMMON INTERVIEW CONFUSIONS

Strategy vs State
Strategy = switch algorithm
State = change behavior due to state

Mediator vs Observer
Mediator = central controller
Observer = broadcast notifications

Command vs Chain
Command = request object
Chain = request pipeline

---

---

# REAL SYSTEM EXAMPLES

Uber pricing → Strategy  
Order status → State  
Event bus → Observer  
Middleware → Chain  
Undo → Command  
Workflow engine → Template  

---

---

# SENIOR ENGINEER SIGNAL

Mentioning behavioral patterns proves:

- real system experience
- architecture maturity
- production exposure
- scalable thinking

---

---

# PATTERN COMBINATION INSIGHT

Real systems combine patterns.

Example:

Notification system

Strategy → select channel  
Observer → notify subscribers  
Command → queue message  

---

---

# INTERVIEW POWER SENTENCE

Say:

"This logic can be implemented using Strategy pattern so it remains extensible."

This instantly signals senior thinking.

---

---

# BEHAVIORAL DESIGN CHECKLIST

Before finishing design ask:

✔ Is logic flexible?  
✔ Can behavior change dynamically?  
✔ Are components loosely coupled?  
✔ Can system handle new rules?  

---

---

# PRACTICE TASK

Identify behavioral pattern usage in:

- Spring framework
- Kafka consumers
- HTTP filter chains
- React state updates
- Game engines

---

---

# FINAL PRINCIPLE

Structural patterns shape system.

Behavioral patterns bring system to life.
```
