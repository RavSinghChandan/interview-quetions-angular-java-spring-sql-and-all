### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Service Discovery & Load Balancing**

6. **How does Eureka service registry maintain heartbeats, and what happens when a node fails?**
7. **What's the difference between Ribbon and Spring Cloud LoadBalancer? Why was Ribbon deprecated?**
8. **How does client-side load balancing actually work in Spring Cloud?**
9. **What happens when a Eureka client is not registered but a Feign call is made to that service?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **API Gateway / Edge Services**

11. **How does Spring Cloud Gateway route requests, and how is it different from Zuul?**
12. **What filters can you apply in Gateway â€” and at what lifecycle stages (pre, post)?**
13. **How do you apply rate limiting in API Gateway for specific clients (like per IP)?**
14. **How do you do dynamic routing in API Gateway based on request content?**
15. **How do JWT tokens get validated at the Gateway level without hitting every microservice?**

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**

16. **Explain bulkhead pattern with a real-world analogy â€” and how Resilience4j supports it.**
17. **Whatâ€™s the difference between timeout at the HTTP level vs thread-pool isolation?**
18. **What is the fallback strategy in case of circuit breaker open? Can it be dynamic?**
19. **What happens if fallback itself fails in circuit breaker? How would you design that?**
20. **How do you detect and handle cascading failures across microservices?**

24. **What happens if Config Server is down during app startup â€” how would you handle it?**
25. **What are the tradeoffs between HashiCorp Vault and Spring Cloud Config encryption?**

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. **Distributed Tracing and Logging**
